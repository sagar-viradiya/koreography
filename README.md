<br>
A lightweight Compose Animation utility library to choreograph low-level Animation API (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation#animation) through Kotlin DSL. It does the heavy lifting of dealing with coroutines under the hood so that you can focus on your animation choreography.

## Including in your project
Koreography is available on `mavenCentral()`

```groovy
implementation 'io.github.sagar-viradiya:koreography:0.3.0'
```

## Usage

Creating choreography is the process of recording moves on [Animatable](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation/value-based#animatable), A low level compose animation API. Moves could be either parallel or sequential. A choreography is a composition of such moves that you can declare through clean and concise Kotlin DSL as shown below. 

For example, let's say you want to sequentially animate alpha first and then scale of an image then you can declare the following choreography. You would then apply animatable values that you are animating in choreography in the Image composable as shown below.

### Choreographying sequential animation

```kotlin
val alphaAnimatable = remember {
    Animatable(0f)
}

val scaleAnimatable = remember {
    Animatable(0f)
}

val koreography = rememberKoreography {
    move(
        animatable = alphaAnimatable,
        targetValue = 1f,
        animationSpec = tween(500)
    )
    
    move(
        animatable = scaleAnimatable,
        targetValue = 2f,
        animationSpec = tween(500)
    )
}
.
.
.
Image(
    modifier = Modifier.graphicsLayer {
        alpha = alphaAnimatable.value
        scaleX = scaleAnimatable.value
    }, 
    painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.image)
)
```

### Choreographying parallel animation

Let's say you want to parallelly animate alpha and scale of an image then you can declare the following choreography.

```kotlin
val alphaAnimatable = remember {
    Animatable(0f)
}

val scaleAnimatable = remember {
    Animatable(0f)
}

val koreography = rememberKoreography {
    parallelMoves {
        move(
            animatable = alphaAnimatable,
            targetValue = 1f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        )
        
        move(
            animatable = scaleAnimatable,
            targetValue = 2f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        )
    }
}
.
.
.
Image(
    modifier = Modifier.graphicsLayer {
        alpha = alphaAnimatable.value
        scaleX = scaleAnimatable.value
    }, 
    painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.image)
)
```

### Complex choreography
You can have a nested hierarchy of moves to create complex choreography. The example below has three animations running parallelly and out of them, the last one has two animations within running sequentially.

```kotlin
val alphaAnimatable = remember {
    Animatable(0f)
}

val scaleAnimatable = remember {
    Animatable(0f)
}

val rotationAnimatable = remember {
    Animatable(0f)
}

val translationXAnimatable = remember {
    Animatble(0f)
}

val koreography = rememberKoreography {
    parallelMoves {
        move(
            animatable = alphaAnimatable,
            targetValue = 1f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        )
        
        move(
            animatable = scaleAnimatable,
            targetValue = 2f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        )
        
        sequentialMoves {
            move(
                animatable = rotationAnimatable,
                targetValue = 20f,
                animationSpec = tween(500)
            )
            
            move(
                animatable = translationXAnimatable,
                targetValue = 200f,
                animationSpec = tween(500)
            )
        }
    }
}
.
.
.
Image(
    modifier = Modifier.graphicsLayer {
        alpha = alphaAnimatable.value
        scaleX = scaleAnimatable.value
        translationX = translationXAnimatable.value
        rotationZ = rotationAnimatable.value
    }, 
    painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.image)
)
``` 

### Executing choreography

Once choreography is ready it's time to dance! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º.

#### One time dance

You can execute the choreography once by calling `dance` function. If you wish to get callback after execution of choreography then you can pass trailing lambda.

```kotlin
koreography.dance(scope = coroutineScope) {
    // onDanceFinished : Optional trailing lambda
}
```

#### Repeat dance

You can execute the choreography multiple times by calling `repeatDance` function. Following call executes choreography three times.

```kotlin
koreography.repeatDance(count = 3, scope = coroutineScope) {
    // onDanceFinished : Optional trailing lambda
}
```

#### Infinite dance

You can execute the choreography forever until composition is alive.

```kotlin
koreography.danceForever(scope = coroutineScope){
    // onDanceFinished : Optional trailing lambda
}
```

> Please note the `coroutineScope` should be obtained through `rememberCoroutineScope()`. Make sure you pass coroutine scope which will get cleared once you exit composition.

### Executing choreography based on state change ðŸš€

Executing choreography based on state change is also supported. This API is similar to [`LaunchedEffect`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects#launchedeffect) API of compose side effects.

In the following example, we are executing choreography passed in the trailing lambda of `LaunchKoreography` composable on a state value change. Choreography contains two animations that will be executed sequentially.

```kotlin
val alphaAnimatable = remember {
    Animatable(0f)
}

val scaleAnimatable = remember {
    Animatable(0f)
}

LaunchKoreography(state) {
    move(
        animatbale = alphaAnimatable,
        targetValue = 1f,
        animationSpec = tween(500)
    )
    
    move(
        animatbale = scaleAnimatable,
        targetValue = 2f,
        animationSpec = tween(500)
    )
}
.
.
.
Image(
    modifier = Modifier.graphicsLayer {
        alpha = alphaAnimatable.value
        scaleX = scaleAnimatable.value
    }, 
    painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.image)
)
```
