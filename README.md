# Koreography
A lightweight Compose Animation utility library to choreograph low-level Animation API through Kotlin DSL. It does the heavy lifting of dealing with coroutines under the hood so that you can focus on your animation choreography.

## Including in your project
Add the following dependency in your `build.gradle` file.

```groovy
implementation 'io.github.sagar-viradiya:koreography:0.1.0'
```

## Usage

You can write complex choreography through clean and concise Kotlin DSL. 

### Example 1
The following example consists of two animations running sequentially having two parallel animations (Scale + Fade) within each. The first animation fades in alpha value and scales up the image. The second fade out and scale the image.

```kotlin
// Composable scope

var alpha by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
var scale by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }

val koreography = rememberKoreography {
    parallelMoves {
        move(
            initialValue = 0f,
            targetValue = 1f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, _ ->
            alpha = value
        }
        move(
            initialValue = 0f,
            targetValue = 2f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, _ ->
            scale = value
        }
    }
    parallelMoves {
        move(
            initialValue = 1f,
            targetValue = 0f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, _ ->
            alpha = value
        }
        move(
            initialValue = 2f,
            targetValue = 4f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, _ ->
            scale = value
        }
    }
}
```

Once `Koreography` is ready it's time to dance! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º

```kotlin
// Composable scope
koreography.dance(rememberCoroutineScope())
```

Please note the `rememberCoroutineScope()` passed as a scope. Make sure you pass coroutine scope which will get cleared once you exit composition.

### Example 2

The following animation consists of two animations running sequentially. Each has three animations running parallelly (Scale + Rotate + Fade)

The code for choreographing above animation is there in the sample app.
