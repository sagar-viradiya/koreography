<br>
A lightweight Compose Animation utility library to choreograph low-level Animation API (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/animation#animation) through Kotlin DSL. It does the heavy lifting of dealing with coroutines under the hood so that you can focus on your animation choreography.

## Including in your project
Koreography is available on `mavenCentral()`

```groovy
implementation 'io.github.sagar-viradiya:koreography:0.1.0'
```

## Usage

Creating koreography is the process of recording moves that can be either parallel or sequential. You can declare complex choreography through clean and concise Kotlin DSL. 

### Choreographying sequential animation

```kotlin
val koreography = rememberKoreography {
    move(
        initialValue = 0f,
        targetValue = 1f,
        animationSpec = tween(500)
    ) { value, velocity ->
        // Update the state value used for animation here
    }
    
    move(
        initialValue = 0f,
        targetValue = 2f,
        animationSpec = tween(500)
    ) { value, velocity ->
        // Update the state value used for animation here
    }
}
```

> The `move` call is identical to `animate` suspend function of compose except it is not suspend function since, creating koregraphy is just a process of recording moves

### Choreographying parallel animation

```kotlin
val koreography = rememberKoreography {
    parallelMoves {
        move(
            initialValue = 0f,
            targetValue = 1f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, velocity ->
            // Update the state value used for animation here
        }
        
        move(
            initialValue = 0f,
            targetValue = 2f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, velocity ->
            // Update the state value used for animation here
        }
    }
}
```

### Complex choreography
You can have a nested hierarchy of moves to create complex choreography. The example below has three animations running parallelly and out of them, the last one has two animations within running sequentially.

```kotlin
val koreography = rememberKoreography {
    parallelMoves {
        move(
            initialValue = 0f,
            targetValue = 1f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, velocity ->
            // Update the state value used for animation here
        }
        
        move(
            initialValue = 0f,
            targetValue = 2f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, velocity ->
            // Update the state value used for animation here
        }
        
        sequentialMoves {
            move(
                initialValue = 0f,
                targetValue = 1f,
                animationSpec = tween(500)
            ) { value, velocity ->
                // Update the state value used for animation here
            }
            
            move(
                initialValue = 0f,
                targetValue = 2f,
                animationSpec = tween(500)
            ) { value, velocity ->
                // Update the state value used for animation here
            }
        }
    }
}
``` 

### Executing koreography outside composable scope

Once `Koreography` is ready it's time to dance! ðŸ’ƒðŸ•º.

You can execute the choreography outside the composable scope (button click) by calling `dance` function.

```kotlin
koreography.dance(coroutineScope)
```

> Please note the `coroutineScope` should be obtained through `rememberCoroutineScope()`. Make sure you pass coroutine scope which will get cleared once you exit composition.

### Executing koreography based on state change ðŸš€

Executing choreography based on state change is also supported. This API is similar to [`LaunchedEffect`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/side-effects#launchedeffect) API of compose side effects.

```kotlin
LaunchKoreography(state) {
    move(
        initialValue = 0f,
        targetValue = 1f,
        animationSpec = tween(500)
    ) { value, velocity ->
        // Update the state value used for animation here
    }
    
    move(
        initialValue = 0f,
        targetValue = 2f,
        animationSpec = tween(500)
    ) { value, velocity ->
        // Update the state value used for animation here
    }
}
```

The choreography passed in the trailing lambda above would be executed on every `state` change.

### Example 1
The following example consists of two animations running sequentially having two parallel animations (Scale + Fade) within each. The first animation fades in alpha value and scales up the image. The second fade out and scale the image.

```kotlin
// Composable scope

var alpha by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
var scale by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }

val koreography = rememberKoreography {
    parallelMoves {
        move(
            initialValue = 0f,
            targetValue = 1f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, _ ->
            alpha = value
        }
        
        move(
            initialValue = 0f,
            targetValue = 2f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, _ ->
            scale = value
        }
    }
    
    parallelMoves {
        move(
            initialValue = 1f,
            targetValue = 0f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, _ ->
            alpha = value
        }
        
        move(
            initialValue = 2f,
            targetValue = 4f,
            animationSpec = tween(500)
        ) { value, _ ->
            scale = value
        }
    }
}

koreography.dance(rememberCoroutineScope())
```

### Example 2

The following animation consists of two animations running sequentially. Each has three animations running parallelly (Scale + Rotate + Fade)

The code for choreographing above animation is there in the sample app.
